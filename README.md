## Before you do anything

Install git lfs otherwise you will not get large files like textures when you pull/clone

Please do the edits on your own branches and I will do the merge at last! 

## Setup on clone

Tick all of the options except "Target Occluded Devices" and "Enable Sharing Services" in Mixed Reality Toolkit -> Configure -> Apply Mixed Project Settings then Apply. And in Apply Mixed Reality Scene Settings tick the first 4 options then Apply. Deploy the device in Mixed Reality Toolkit -> Build Window.

Make sure every scene processed like that.
