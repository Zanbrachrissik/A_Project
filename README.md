## Before you do anything

Install git lfs otherwise you will not get large files like textures when you pull/clone

## Setup on clone

### First

If you do not already have it, download and install iOS or Android build tools for Unity.

Open project with Unity, then when it is opened go to File -> Build Settings. Select iOS or Android from platform list and click "switch platform" in bottom left. 

Exit that window and in the game view you should change from "free aspect" to 1920x1080 Portait. Should be one of the first options. If we all develop with this preset we shouldn't run into bad scaling issues early. 

### Second

Make sure both Combat and Explore are in file -> build settings
